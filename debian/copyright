 In order to make this project usable
 to a vast majority of developers,
 we distribute it

 when using FreeType 2
 in any of your projects or products.
  * The FreeType License,

    will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    For the avoidance of doubt,
    where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram,
    the synchronization of the Work
    in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
    will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  * "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
    such as encyclopedias and anthologies,
    or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
    or other works or subject matter
    other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
    which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
    constitute intellectual creations,
    in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
    along with one or more other contributions,
    each constituting separate and independent works in themselves,
    which together are assembled into a collective whole.
    A work that constitutes a Collection
    will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below)
    for the purposes of this License.
  * "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license
    that is listed at <https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses>

    the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
    who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret

    a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature;
    a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show;
    a musical composition with or without words;

 3. License Grant.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You
 a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
 (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
 license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
  * to Reproduce the Work,
    to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
    and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  * to create and Reproduce Adaptations
    provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium,
    takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work.
    For example, a translation could be marked
    "The original work was translated from English to Spanish,"
    or a modification could indicate
    "The original work has been modified.";
  * to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work
    including as incorporated in Collections; and,
  * to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  * For the avoidance of doubt:
    + Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.
      In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
      through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
      the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties
      for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    + Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.
      In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties

    + Voluntary License Schemes.
      The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
      whether individually
      or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
      of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes,
      via that society,
      from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter devised.
 The above rights include
 the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
 to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
 Subject to Section 8(f),
 all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 The license granted in Section 3 above
 is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  * You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
    only under the terms of this License.
    You must include
    a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License
    with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
    You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
    that restrict the terms of this License
    or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
    You may not sublicense the Work.
    You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
    and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
    of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
    When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work,
    You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License.
    This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection,
    but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself
    to be made subject to the terms of this License.
    If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
    as requested.
    If You create an Adaptation,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c),
    as requested.
  * You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation
    only under the terms of: (i) this License;
    (ii) a later version of this License
    with the same License Elements as this License;
    (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
    (either this or a later license version)
    that contains the same License Elements as this License
    (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License.
    If you license the Adaptation
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv),
    you must comply with the terms of that license.
    If you license the Adaptation
    under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
    (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
    and the following provisions:
    (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License
    with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform;
    (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation
    that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
    or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;
    (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License
    and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work
    as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform;
    (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,
    You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation
    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You
    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the Applicable License.
    This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation
    as incorporated in a Collection,
    but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself
    to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
  * If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform
    the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,
    You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
    keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
    and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
    (i) the name of the Original Author
    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties
    (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
    for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means,
    the name of such party or parties;
    (ii) the title of the Work if supplied;
    (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any,
    that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
    unless such URI does not refer
    to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
    (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
    or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
    The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
    in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
    at a minimum such credit will appear,
    if a credit for all contributing authors
    of the Adaptation or Collection appears,
    then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent
    as the credits for the other contributing authors.
    For the avoidance of doubt,
    You may only use the credit required by this Section
    for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
    and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
    You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by
    the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
    of You or Your use of the Work,
    without the separate, express prior written permission
    of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
  * Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
    or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law,
    if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
    either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections,
    You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
    which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),
    in which any exercise of the right
    granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
    would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification
    or other derogatory action
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation,
    the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section,
    to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law,
    to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
    under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
 AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
 EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
 IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
 FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
  * This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities
    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
    however, will not have their licenses terminated
    provided such individuals or entities remain
    in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive
    any termination of this License.
  * Subject to the above terms and conditions,
    the license granted here is perpetual
    (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above,
    Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms
    or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve
    to withdraw this License (or any other license
    that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License),
    and this License will continue in full force and effect
    unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
  * Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
    on the same terms and conditions
    as the license granted to You under this License.
  * Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
    on the same terms and conditions
    as the license granted to You under this License.
  * If any provision of this License is invalid
    or unenforceable under applicable law,
    it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License,
    and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
    such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
    to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  * No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
    and no breach consented to
    unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  * This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here.
    There are no understandings, agreements or representations
    with respect to the Work not specified here.
    Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions
    that may appear in any communication from You.
    This License may not be modified
    without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  * The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced,
    in this License
    were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
    (as amended on September 28, 1979),
    the Rome Convention of 1961,
    the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,
    the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect
    in the relevant jurisdiction
    in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation
    of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
    If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License,
    such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
    this License is not intended to restrict the license
    of any rights under applicable law.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
 The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
 some of them may contain,
 in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 various tools and contributions
 which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
 .
 This license applies to all files found in such packages,
 and which do not fall under their own explicit license.
 The license affects thus the FreeType font engine,
 the test programs, documentation and makefiles,
 at the very least.
 .
 This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic,
 and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses,
 which all encourage inclusion and use of free software
 in commercial and freeware products alike.
 As a consequence, its main points are that:
  * We don't promise that this software works.
    However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports.
    ("as is" distribution)
  * You can use this software for whatever you want,
    in parts or full form,
    without having to pay us.
    ("royalty-free" usage)
  * You may not pretend that you wrote this software.
    If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program,
    you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation
    that you have used the FreeType code.
    ("credits")
 .
 We specifically permit and encourage
 the inclusion of this software,
 with or without modifications,
 in commercial products.
 We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project
 and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 Finally, many people asked us
 for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer
 to use in compliance with this license.
 We thus encourage you to use the following text:
 .
 """
 Portions of this software are copyright
 ¬© <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).
 All rights reserved.
 """
 .
 Please replace <year> with the value
 from the FreeType version you actually use.
 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
 Throughout this license,
 the terms "package", "FreeType Project", and "FreeType archive"
 refer to the set of files originally distributed
 by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg)
 as the "FreeType Project",
 be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
 .
 "You" refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
 where "using" is a generic term
 including compiling the project's source code
 as well as linking it to form a "program" or "executable".
 This program is referred to
 as "a program using the FreeType engine".
 .
 This license applies to all files distributed
 in the original FreeType Project,
 including all source code, binaries and documentation,
 unless otherwise stated in the file
 in its original, unmodified form
 as distributed in the original archive.
 If you are unsure whether or not
 a particular file is covered by this license,
 you must contact us to verify this.
 .
 The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000
 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.
 All rights reserved except as specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 -
 THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
 EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE
 FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE,
 OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
 This license grants
 a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license
 to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy,
 create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
 the FreeType Project
 (in both source and object code forms)
 and derivative works thereof for any purpose;
 and to authorize others
 to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein,
 subject to the following conditions:
 .
  * Redistribution of source code must retain
    this license file ("FTL.TXT") unaltered;
    any additions, deletions or changes to the original files
    must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
    The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files
    must be preserved in all copies of source files.
  * Redistribution in binary form must provide
    a disclaimer that states
    that the software is based in part
    of the work of the FreeType Team,
    in the distribution documentation.
    We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page
    in your documentation,
    though this isn't mandatory.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software
 derived from or based on the FreeType Project,
 not just the unmodified files.
 If you use our work, you must acknowledge us.
 However, no fee need be paid to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
 Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you
 shall use the name of the other
 for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
 without specific prior written permission.
 .
 We suggest, but do not require,
 that you use one or more of the following phrases
 to refer to this software
 in your documentation or advertising materials:
 "FreeType Project", "FreeType Engine",
 "FreeType library", or "FreeType Distribution".
 .
 As you have not signed this license,
 you are not required to accept it.
 However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material,
 only this license,
 or another one contracted with the authors,
 grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
 Therefore,
 by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project,
 you indicate that you understand and accept
 all the terms of this license.
 .
 4. Contacts
 -----------
 .
 There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
  * freetype@nongnu.org
 .
    Discusses general use and applications of FreeType,
    as well as future and wanted additions
    to the library and distribution.
    If you are looking for support,
    start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you
    in the documentation.
